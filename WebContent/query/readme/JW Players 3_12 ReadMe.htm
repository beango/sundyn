href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/wizard.html">setup wizard</A>.</P>
<H2 id=installing>INSTALLING</H2>
<P>The example HTML file in the download works right out of the box. If you look 
at it's source code (in a text or HTML editor), you can see that the SWF files 
are inserted in the page with a small javascript. These javascripts use the 
external swfobject.js script by <A 
href="http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/">Geoff Stearns</A> in order to 
prevent the annoying "click here to activate" message. If you copy the SWF to 
your website, make sure you don't forget to copy the swfobject.js file as well. 
It is inserted in the HTML page right at the top:</P><PRE>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="swfobject.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</PRE>
<P>An insertion javascript allows you to set the location of the SWF, it's width 
and height, a name, the version of Flash that is needed and the backgroundcolor 
of the movie. You can also send a list of flashvars (with the addVariable() 
command) to the SWF to configure it (for that see the next paragraph). When the 
HTML page loads, the javascript replaces the element of your HTML with the "id" 
you provided in the javascript (make sure you have an element with that 
id!).</P><PRE>&lt;p id="player"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"&gt;Get Flash&lt;/a&gt; to see this player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	var so = new SWFObject('mediaplayer.swf','player','400','400','7');
	so.addParam("allowfullscreen","true");
	so.addVariable("file","test.flv");
	so.addVariable("displayheight","300");
	so.write('player');
&lt;/script&gt;</PRE>
<P>If you cannot use javascript on your website (for example if you run the SWF 
on a profile site like MySpace), you can use an "embed" code instead of the 
javascript. Your SWF will probably be on another server then. That is OK, but 
note that your XML playlist (if used) should always reside on the same server 
than your SWF, or else the security restrictions won't allow the player to load 
it. Having MP3 or JPG or FLV files on a different server is no problem.</P><PRE>&lt;embed src="http://www.myfileserver.com/folder/mediaplayer.swf" width="400" height="400" 
type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" 
flashvars="file=http://www.myfileserver.com/folder/test.flv&amp;displayheight=300" /&gt;</PRE>
<H2 id=flashvars>FLASHVARS</H2>
<P>Flashvars are variables you can insert into your HTML code to control both 
behavior and appearance of the player/rotator. With the swfobject embed method, 
you add them with the addVariable() function and in the embed method they are 
inside the "flashvars" attribute, stacked with an "&amp;" symbol. <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/wizard.html">At this page</A> you'll 
find a wizard in which you can easily set all flashvars. In the lists below, all 
flashvars are explained.</P>
<P><B>All variables with an * are also available to the rotator.</B></P>
<H3 id=basic>BASIC FLASHVARS</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>displayheight</B> (number): This flashvar is used by the players and 
  sets the height of the display. It defaults to the height of the SWF object 
  minus the controlbar (20px), but if you set it to a smaller height, the 
  playlist will show up. If you set it to the height of the player itself (or 
  larger), the controlbar will auto-hide over the video. 
  <LI><B>file</B>* (url): The location of the file to play. It can be a single 
  file (MP3/FLV/RTMP/JPG/SWF/PNG/GIF) or a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">playlist</A> 
  for the players. The rotator only accepts playlists. 
  <LI><B>height</B>* (number): As with the width of the player/rotator, this 
  variable is already set with a default embed code. However, sometimes (notably 
  on IE), this won't get through (so you get a messed-up display). Then use this 
  flashvar to tell the player/rotator how many pixels high it should be. 
  <LI><B>image</B> (url): If you play MP3 of FLV files, you can use this 
  flashvar to show a preview image or album cover. It can be a JPG/SWF/PNG/GIF 
  file. You can also assign an image for every item in a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">playlist</A>. 

  <LI><B>shownavigation</B>* (true,false): Another flashvar only for the 
  rotator. It enables/disables the navigation bar. 
  <LI><B>transition</B>* 
  (bgfade,blocks,bubbles,circles,fade,flash,fluids,lines,random,slowfade): This 
  flashvar is only used by the rotator. It sets the transition to use between 
  images. "random" will show all transitions randomly. The default is "fade". 
  <LI><B>width</B>* (number): As with the height of the player/rotator, this 
  variable is already set with a default embed code. However, sometimes (notably 
  on IE), this won't get through (so you get a messed-up display). Then use this 
  flashvar to tell the player/rotator how many pixels wide it should be. 
</LI></UL>
<H3 id=color>COLOR FLASHVARS</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>backcolor</B>* (color): Backgroundcolor of the player/rotator. In the 
  "extras" folder of this download there's a colorpicker script with which you 
  can pick a color value. The default for the players is 0xFFFFFF (white) and 
  for the rotator 0x000000 (black). 
  <LI><B>frontcolor</B>* (color): Texts / buttons color of the player/rotator. 
  The default for the players is 0x000000 (black) and for the rotator 0xFFFFFF 
  (white). 
  <LI><B>lightcolor</B>* (color): Rollover/ active color of the player/rotator. 
  The default for the players is 0x000000 (black) and for the rotator 0xCC0000 
  (red). 
  <LI><B>screencolor</B> (color): Color of the display background screen. The 
  default is 0x000000 (black). Instead of choosing another color, you can of 
  course also set a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#basic">background 
  image</A>. </LI></UL>
<H3 id=appearance>APPEARANCE FLASHVARS</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>autoscroll</B> (true,false): By default, the playlist area of the 
  players will have a scrollbar if the number of items is too long. If you set 
  this flashvar to "true", the scrollbar wil disappear and the playlist will 
  scroll automatically, depending upon the mouse position. 
  <LI><B>displaywidth</B> (number of pixels): Instead of the "displayheight", 
  you can set "displaywidth" to a size smaller that the SWF width to make the 
  playlist appear at the right side of the display. 
  <LI><B>kenburns</B>* (true,false): Set this to true to apply the <A 
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_Effect">Ken Burns effect</A> to 
  images in the rotator. Note that this works best when using large images from 
  the same server on a fast computer. Small images from different servers and 
  slow computers produce blurry results and choppy motion. Works also best in 
  combination with the "slowfade" transition. 
  <LI><B>largecontrols</B> (true,false): Set this to true to make the controlbar 
  twice as large. This is useful to visually impaired users. 
  <LI><B>logo</B>* (url): Set this flashvar to put a watermark logo in the top 
  right corner of the display. All image formats are supported, but transparent 
  PNG files give the best results. 
  <LI><B>overstretch</B>* (true,false,fit,none): Defines how to stretch 
  images/movies to make them fit the display. "true" will stretch them 
  proportionally to fill the display, "false" will stretch them to fit. "fit" 
  will stretch them disproportionally to fit both height and width. "none" will 
  show all items in their original dimensions. Defaults to "fit" for the players 
  and "false" for the rotator. 
  <LI><B>showdigits</B> (true,false,total): Set this to false if you don't want 
  the elapsed/remaining time to display in the controlbar of the players. Quite 
  handy to save some space. Set it to "total" to show the total time instead of 
  the remaining time. 
  <LI><B>showdownload</B> (true,false): Set this to true to show a 
  downloadbutton in the controlbar. The downloadbutton links to the <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#interaction">link 
  flashvar</A>. 
  <LI><B>showeq</B> (true,false): Set to true to show a fake equalizer in the 
  display. It adds a nice graphical touch when you are playing MP3 files. 
  <LI><B>showicons</B>* (true,false): Show or hide the play and activity icons 
  in the middle of the display. Defaults to true for the players and false for 
  the rotator. If set to false, the overlaid controlbar will also hide with the 
  players. 
  <LI><B>showvolume</B> (true,false): Set this to false to hide the volume 
  button and save space. 
  <LI><B>thumbsinplaylist</B> (true,false): If you have a playlist that also 
  includes preview images with the &lt;image&gt; element, you can set this 
  flashvar to "true" to show them in the playlist. </LI></UL>
<H3 id=playback>PLAYBACK FLASHVARS</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>autostart</B> (true,false,muted): Set this to "true" to make the player 
  automatically start playing when the page loads. If set to "muted", the player 
  will autostart with the volume set to 0 and an unmute icon in the display. 
  <LI><B>bufferlength</B> (number): This sets the number of seconds an FLV 
  should be buffered ahead before the player starts it. Set this smaller for 
  fast connections or short videos. Set this bigger for slow connections. The 
  default is 3 seconds. 
  <LI><B>repeat</B>* (true,false,list): By default, the players will stop 
  playback after every item to preserve bandwidth (repeat=false). You can set 
  this to "list" to playback all items in a playlist once, or to "true" to 
  continously playback your song/movie/playlist. 
  <LI><B>rotatetime</B>* (number): Use this flashvar to set the number of 
  seconds you want an image to display. The default is "10" for the mediaplayer 
  and "5" for the rotator. 
  <LI><B>shuffle</B>* (true,false): If you use a playlist, the players and 
  rotator will automatically shuffle the entries to prevent boredom. Set this 
  flashvar to "false" to play all items sequentially. 
  <LI><B>smoothing</B> (true,false): If set to "false", video will not smooth, 
  resulting in a more pixelated, but better performing display. Use this for 
  large screen / slow computer combinations. 
  <LI><B>start</B>* (second): If you use RTMP or HTTP streaming (not for regular 
  FLV or MP3 files); use this flashvar to specify an offset start position. You 
  can also use this flashvar in <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">XSPF 
  playlists</A>, so you can make a chapter index of a single file. 
  <LI><B>volume</B>* (number): The default volume for playback of sounds/movies 
  is 80, but you can set another startup value with this flashvar. </LI></UL>
<H3 id=interaction>INTERACTION FLASHVARS</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>audio</B>* (url): You can set this flashvar to the location of an 
  external mp3 file that should serve as an additional audiotrack. Use this for 
  accessibility commentary, director's comments or, with the imagerotator, 
  background music.</A> 
  <LI><B>bwfile</B> (url): Image to use for bandwidth checking; used in 
  conjunction with <I>bwstreams</I>. Assign a simple image to this flashvar (<A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/100k.jpg">this one</A> will do 
  nice), or the rtmp location of the serverside bwcheck script that <A 
  href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashcom/articles/flvideo_bandwidth_print.html">can 
  be downloaded here</A>. Here's an <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/bandwidthcheck.html">example 
  bandwidth checking player</A>. 
  <LI><B>bwstreams</B> (comma-separated list of bitrates): The different streams 
  to use for bandwidth checking; used in conjunction with <I>bwfile</I>. If, for 
  example, you want to play the video <I>video.flv</I> and set this to 
  <I>100,250,500,1000</I> and the player detects a bandwidth of 349kbps, the 
  file <I>video_250.flv</I> will be played. Here's an <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/bandwidthcheck.html">example 
  bandwidth checking player</A>. Note that bandwidth checking is ignored for 
  audio and images! 
  <LI><B>callback</B> (url): Set this flashvar to the location of a serverside 
  script (PHP/ASP) that can process callbacks. The players will send a callback 
  every time an item starts/stops, so you can save statistics with the 
  serverside script. More info can be found in this <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/statistics.html">demonstration 
  page</A>. An example callback script is placed in the "extras" folder of the 
  downloads. Set this to "analytics" to send the callbacks automatically to 
  Google Analytics. 
  <LI><B>captions</B> (url): You can set this flashvar to the location of an 
  external textfile with captions. The players support SMIL's TimedText format 
  (<A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/subtitles_example.xml">example</A>) 
  and the SRT format (<A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/subtitles_example.txt">example</A>) 
  used with ripped DVD's. Set this flashvar to "captionate" if your FLV file has 
  <A href="http://www.buraks.com/captionate/">Captionate captions</A> embedded. 
  If you use multitrack Captionate captions, you can set this flashvar to 
  "captionate0", "captionate3" etc. to display a certain track. A live example 
  of different captions <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/accessibility.html">can be found 
  here</A>. You can also assign captions for every item in a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">playlist</A>. 

  <LI><B>enablejs</B>* (true,false): Set this to true to enable javascript 
  interaction. This'll only work online! Javascript interaction includes 
  playback control, asynchroneous loading of media files and return of track 
  information to javascript.An example of all supported javascript functions can 
  be found <A href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/javascript.html">on 
  this page</A>. 
  <LI><B>fsbuttonlink</B> (url): The players automatically shows a fullscreen 
  button if a user has installed a capable flashplayer (from 9.0.28). With this 
  flashvar, you can link to an alternative page to display a sort-of fullscreen 
  version of the player. Use serverside variables or the getQueryParamValue() 
  function of <A href="http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/">SWF Object</A> to 
  send the "file" and any other flashvars to that fullscreen-substitute page. 
  <LI><B>id</B> (string): The unique identifier of the file to play. It will be 
  sent to serverside callbacks(see below here, and is also used when using RTMP 
  streams. In the latter case, the "file" flashvar points to the rtmp:// stream, 
  and this "id" flashvar to the precise file to play. You can also assign an id 
  for every item in a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">playlist</A>. 

  <LI><B>javascriptid</B>* (string): If you control multiple players/rotators 
  with javascript, you can use this flashvar to give each of them a unique ID. 
  It will be returned with every call to the getUpdate() event. Demo <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/javascript.html">on this page</A>. 
  <LI><B>link</B> (url): Set here the url to an external URL, downloadeable 
  version of the file, or <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/">force-download script</A> you can 
  use for downloading the file. You can assign link-clicks to the display (see 
  below), the <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#appearance">downloadbutton</A> 
  and every item in a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">playlist</A>. 

  <LI><B>linkfromdisplay</B>* (true,false): You can set this flashvar to "true" 
  to make a click on the image/video display to result in a jump to the "link" 
  webpage. By default, a click on the display will play/pause the movie. 
  <LI><B>linktarget</B>* (frame): The targetframe a link (from the display or 
  playlist buttons) will open into. The default is "_self". Set it to "_blank" 
  to open links in a new window. 
  <LI><B>streamscript</B> (url): This flashvar is the URL of an optional script 
  to use for 'fake streaming' FLV files, eg. through PHP, ASP or LigHTTPD. The 
  parameters 'file' and 'pos' are sent to the script. An example file, 
  "stream.php", can be found in the "extras" folder of the downloads. If you use 
  the LigHTTPD FLV module, set this to the value "lighttpd". Note that all FLV 
  files you want to fake-stream should have an <A 
  href="http://www.buraks.com/flvmdi/">array with keyframe-positions</A> in 
  their metadata! More info and a running example can be found <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/streaming.html">at this page</A>. 
  <LI><B>type</B> (mp3,flv,rtmp,jpg,png,gif,swf,rbs,3gp,mp4,m4v): The players 
  determine the type of file to play based upon the last three characters of the 
  "file" flashvar. This method doesn't work if you use database id's or 
  mod_rewrite to retrieve the files. Therefore you can set this flashvar to tell 
  the players of which filetype the file you want to play is. The type is also 
  assigned to every item in a <A 
  href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/readme.html#playlists">playlist</A>. 
  If no match is found, the player assumes it loads a playlist. 
  <LI><B>useaudio</B> (true,false): Set this to false to force the additional 
  audiotrack to mute by default. 
  <LI><B>usecaptions</B> (true,false): Set this to false to force the captions 
  to hide by default. 
  <LI><B>usefullscreen</B> (true,false): Set this flashvar to false if you don't 
  want to use the flash9 fullscreen functionality. If you added a "fsbuttonlink" 
  flashvar as well, this link will become the default action for the fullscreen 
  page. 
  <LI><B>usekeys</B> (true,false): Set this to false to disable keyboard input 
  (SPACE,UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT) for the players. </LI></UL>
<P>Note that you must urlencode any ? = &amp; symbols inside flashvars. The 
urlencoded values for these symbols are: <I>?</I> ¡ú <I>%3F</I>, <I>=</I> ¡ú 
<I>%3D</I>, <I>&amp;</I> ¡ú <I>%26</I>. So if your "file" flashvar has the value 
of getplaylist.php?id=123, you can set it like this: 
getplaylist.php%3Fid%3D123.</P>
<H2 id=playlists>PLAYLISTS</H2>
<P>You can load a single file as well as an entire playlist of files into the 
players. The players look at the filename to determine whether a single file or 
a playlist is loaded. For example, if your file is test.mp3, it will presume you 
load a single MP3 file, because the extension is "mp3". If your filename is 
getlist.php, the SWF will see a playlist. If you use dynamic scripts to load a 
single file (e.g. getmovie.php%3Fid%3D123), you can tell the player which file 
it loads by using the additional "type" flashvar: "type=flv".</P>
<P>The players support three commonly used playlist formats to ensure maximum 
compatibility: <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSPF">XSPF</A> (much used 
for CC music), <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</A> (much-used for 
Podcasts) and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATOM">ATOM</A> (much-used by 
Blogs). The example playlist.xml that comes with the downloads is in XSPF 
format. On my website, I've placed additional examples of both <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/xspf_example.xml">an xspf 
playlist</A> and <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/rss_example.xml">an rss playlist</A>, 
with nearly all supported tags included. If you assign a regular feed without 
any media enclosures to the player, the player will use the API from <A 
href="http://www.talkr.com/">Talkr.com</A> to perform a text-to-speech operation

<P>* The Image Rotator will only playback the 'audio' of the first item in the 
playlist, to provide background music. The players support a per-element extra 
audio track.</P>
<P>** The "category" element can be used to specify advertisements. You can set 
it to "preroll", "postroll" or "overlay". Use the "link" element of the 
playlistentry to set the commercial's URL. In the extras of my website, there's 
an <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/advertisements.html">advertisements 
example page</A>.</P>
<P>*** The "start" element is only supported by XSPF playlists, and only works 
with streaming files (HTTP or RTMP). Use it to specify the starting position in 
seconds. <A href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/streaming.html">Here's an 
example page</A>.</P>
<P>**** If the XSPF "location" url doesn't contain a useful extension (e.g. 
"mp3" or "flv"), use the "meta" element to tell the player which filetype it is 
(e.g. &lt;meta rel='"type"&gt;mp3&lt;/meta&gt; ). For RSS and ATOM, the filetype 
is automatically extracted from the mimetype.</P>
<P>Note that, if you play a single file, you can send each item in this table as 
a flashvar to the SWF. This way, you can add an image, title, id, link, etc. to 
a single file as well. So if you have, for example, the flvplayer and a single 
file "video.flv" and want to display a preview image too, you can set the 
flashvars "file=video.flv" and "image=preview.jpg". For refering to RTMP 
streams, the additional "id" flashvar has to be sent as well. Example: 
"file=rtmp://my.streaming.server/mypath" and "id=video_one".</P>
<P>I'd like to point out two common pitfalls users encounter when using 
playlists. First, a playlist should always reside on the same server as the SWF 
file, due to security restrictions of the Flash Player (there is a small 
workaround, tunneling the external feed through a serverside script. <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/upload/external_feed.zip">Here's an example 
in PHP</A>.). Second, always try to use full URL's (including the http:// part) 
when referring to files, links or images in your playlists. It will save you a 
lot of troubles with unresponsive SWF's or "file not found" errors!</P>
<P>I've included some additional PHP scripts in the <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/">"extras" folder of my website</A>, 
two for auto-creating playlists and one for force-downloading files.</P>
<H2 id=customization>CUSTOMIZATION</H2>
<P>I receive a lot of requests for creating customized versions of my players. 
In most cases however, a clever setting of the flashvars already fulfilled the 
requests, so please make sure you check these first! <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/wizard.html">I've made an online 
wizard you can use to easily set all flashvars</A>. Additionally, I do not 
design or program any particular (paid-for) customizations (I just don't have 
time for it), but interesting features will be plugged into the next update of 
the players.</P>
<P>If you are familiar with actionscripting yourself, you should find that 
changing or adding to the players is quite simple. To get started, check out 
this schematic overview of the player's code. Note that the flvplayer, mp3player 
and mediaplayer are identical in terms of code:</P>
<P><IMG alt="schematic overview of the players" 
src="JW Players 3_12 ReadMe_files/schematics.gif"></P>
<P>A player starts by instantiating either the ImageRotator or Mediaplayer 
class, which loads all config and playlist variables and sets up the MCV cycle. 
The config and feeder objects are available to each member of the MCV cycle. The 
two <SPAN style="COLOR: #c00">objects in red</SPAN> have javascript handlers, so 
all their functions are available through javascript. Here is <A 
href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/extras/javascript.html">an online page with 
examples of all javascript functions</A>.</P>
<P>Communication between the MCV's members is strictly defined (with the 
updates, changes and events). Creating a complete new look for any of the 
players (or adding something like a rating field or recommendations) can be done 
by creating a new class that extends the AbstractView and instantiating it in 
the MediaPlayer.as class. The ControlbarView class is a good AbstractView 
extension to copy and modify for this purpose (it contains all controlbar 
graphics).</P>
<P>Because of the many requests to hide part of the url for media files to 
prevent stealing, I have added a single line of code to the script in the FLA's 
timeline. If you un-comment this line (//var prefix = "..."), you can set here a 
prefix url the players will use for the FLV/MP3/etc. Set this e.g. to the 
directory where your mediafiles are located 
(http://www.jeroenwijering.com/uploads/), and then you only have to add the 
filename of your mediafiles to the flashvars/playlists.</P>
<P>Placing the player/rotator into another Flash file is also possible. Just 
copy-paste the player or rotator symbol from the FLA file in the download to 
your FLA file. Also make sure you copy the "com" directory to the directory of 
your FLA file as well; it contains all scripting. If that's done, you can set 
all flashvars as variables in the root timeline and start the player from there 
as well. Make sure you set the "width" and "height" flashvar too, or the 
player/rotator will stretch to your entire stage! Here's an example:</P><PRE>// Set the flashvars (booleans and numbers should also be quoted)
var width = "320";
var height = "240";
var file = "my_video.flv";
var autostart = "true";
// Start the player
var mpl = new com.jeroenwijering.players.MediaPlayer(this.player);</PRE>
<P>Additionally, I have made the controller a public object, so you can control 
the mediaplayer with the getEvent() function from anywhere in your flash site 
(the schematic above has a list of all getEvent() options). Let's continue the 
small script above:</P><PRE>// Control the mediaplayer
mpl.controller.getEvent("volume",50);
mpl.controller.getEvent("playpause");</PRE>

<P>Here's a small list with frequently-encountered problems:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>If you get strange display errors on IE (most notably after refreshing), 
  the Stage dimensions are probably not properly set. You can use flashvars 
  "width" and "height" to force specific dimensions to the player/rotator and 
  fix this problem. 
  <LI>Note that, due to security restrictions in the Flash Player, javascript 
  interaction will not work when testing locally. Accessing remote media files 
  or jumping to remote URL's also won't work because of this. Both will work 
  fine if you test from your webserver. 
  <LI>True fullscreen only works if you have the <A 
  href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">Flash 
  Player 9,0,28,0</A> or higher installed. If you use the <A 
  href="http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/">SWFObject javascript</A> to embed 
  your player, you can use it's auto-update functionality. Also make sure you 
  have the parameter "allowfullscreen" set to "true" in your embed code! 
  <LI>If the progressbar isn't running with your FLV file, or if your video 
  dimensions are messed-up, your FLV file doesn't have correct metadata 
  inserted. You can fix this by using the small tool available at <A 
  title="The Buraks FLV Metadata Injector" 
  href="http://www.buraks.com/flvmdi/">www.buraks.com/flvmdi/</A>. 
  <LI>If the player plays FLV files on your computer but not on your website and 
  your website is running of an IIS server, then the FLV mimetype isn't added to 
  the server yet. You can check this by typing in the direct address to your FLV 
  file in your browser. If you get a 404, you're on IIS without mimetype. Please 
  contact your webserver administrator on this (if you're an admin, <A 
  href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_19439">here's 
  how to fix it</A>). 
  <LI>If you encounter too fast or too slow playback of MP3 files or if your 
  progressbar is messed up, your MP3 files contains variable bitrate encoding. 
  Flash isn't very good at handling these, it's best to stick to constant 
  bitrate encoding. Also make sure to stick to a sampling frequency that is a 
  multitude of 11.025kHz (48kHz, for example, also poses problems). The free <A 
  href="http://www.apple.com/itunes">iTunes software</A> has a basic, decent MP3 
  encoder. 
  <LI>The player/rotator will run quite OK inside the Flash Player 7. However, 
  the following features are not supported: display of GIF/PNG images, smoothing 
  of scaled images/video, VP6 encoded video, javascript control and the digits 
  in the controlbar. </LI></UL>
